There are couple of endpoints for fetching data from table. 
To check if all works fine please install project localy, install all dependencies via composer. Also you will need to run migrations and seed data.
After that you will be able to perform endpoints from api.php file from routes folder.
I have covered main logig by unit tests as well.
